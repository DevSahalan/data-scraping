Market-driven, disruptive startup with experienced team is seeking a Senior Developer with front end or full-stack development abilities.

Our team is led by serial entrepreneurs including both a CEO and CTO with a history of multiple exits. In addition, our team consists of data scientists, finance specialists, digital marketing professionals, and an experienced CEO with a background in AI/machine learning and business development. The founders also spearheaded a public alpha test which, although intended solely to garner extrapolatable market data from a small test group, resulted in overwhelming, explosive growth and user adoption that we were not prepared for. In direct response to this unintentional early market traction, we are currently scaling up the team and development horsepower in order to expand the next version of our product in several strategic regions.

Our 2020 focus is on building out and releasing the scalable beta product in order to rapidly drive revenue into the high-six or low-seven digits within one year. The current team is receiving all compensation in company stock in order to preserve existing capital until the full product launch and achievement of stable revenue. Salaries will be provided once access to greater capital is available through revenue streams and/or the obtainment of additional funding. As such, compensation for this position is strictly company stock until access to greater capital is available.

Please note that we are not looking for an employee -- we are looking for a fellow team member who possesses the passion, motivation, and competency necessary to go forth with us as we scale and continue to build something truly disruptive.The current founding team possesses expertise in many critical fields, from finance to marketing to data science to business operations, and we are looking to add a Senior Developer with either front end or full-stack development capability that can bring their own unique expertise and passion to the team.

Next book is in early stages and we're aiming for the startup philosophy of ""You should be embarrassed by the first version you ship"".  Working title is ""100 days to a $200k+ job"".

Here's the preamble that we're posting publicly to recruit early readers:

My coauthor and I are both highly-paid employees at Big Tech companies.

That's today.  

Previously, we both failed multiple ""big tech"" interview processes then succeeded.

And now we're writing a simple book to teach people a systematic step-by-step process to succeed.

We both felt overwhelmed by the book Cracking the Coding Interview and the super-pricey ""Interview Cake"" course, and The Algorithm Design Manual... and even after buying these, didn't get through them – we said ""screw it"". After all, we're both passionate programmers, have worked at many startups, and have tons of industry experience (only one of us has a CS degree).

What we did was conquer the path into great jobs at great companies and we want to pave the way for others. As such, we are seeking ""beta readers"" to provide brutal feedback on an early draft of our book.  

This is a simple, easy-to-read book – it's a manual, and it's intended to be as readable as a GETTINGSTARTED.md guide of an easy-breezy open source project.  

This is NOT a bootcamp; this NOT an income-share agreement program.  

This is a book (currently, a manuscript in Google Docs format), and we need people to provide brutal feedback.

Here are our expectations:

0) Send me an DM with a quick blurb on your background.  You should have at least one year of industry experience as a programmer, but even better if you have 10+.  We'll reach out and schedule an intro call at your convenience.

1) You read through the entire draft and provide Comments in the Google Doc:

* When you get bored, stop reading, and check social media (HN/Twitter/Reddit/etc)
* When you roll your eyes
* When you want to share a quote or section with a friend
* When you laugh, get excited, or feel hooked
* Which sections you loved, and which ones you hated
* Anytime something is confusing or rubs you the wrong way

2) Phone call once you're done for a full debrief

3) In exchange, you get:

* Highly likely chance of increasing your income permanently
* Paperback copy of the book upon release
* Your name in the acknowledgments sections of the book
* $50 gift card (small token of gratitude, rather to illustrate that we have skin in the game)


Interested?  DM and proceed.    ",, Described in the post.

Seeking Tech Savvy Leader to Spearhead Software Launch,https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/sof/d/san-francisco-seeking-tech-savvy-leader/7134589454.html,2020-06-02 12:00, (San Francisco),"
        
Please note that I am NOT looking to hire development staff -- I am looking for an individual capable of raising capital and who wants to be part of a new and exciting company. 

Hello there!

I am a solo-entrepreneur holding the exclusive patent to bulk interactive text messaging (see US Pat. No. 9,742,709 B1) which I designed to specifically handle mass remote triaging and communications for pandemics such as we are currently facing. I have developed an MVP for this, and have shown it to a number of emergency professionals - unfortunately they were in the buying, and not in the investing positions.

If you have the experience and passion to seek out an investment and help bring this to market, I am prepared to provide an EXCEPTIONAL equity position (i.e. non-dilutable, full percentage points). I have the full support of a national law firm that is doing all my legal work on a deferred payment basis, and I know this system can work. Surprisingly, there is not much complexity to it, and the return potential is phenomenal. My original to-market budget is $6M; with 5yr returns projected >$600M in a $20B market space where there is no clear leader.

I encourage you to please watch my demo video at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAH596zIxM8 so you can see this in action for yourself.

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED: please reply with an email describing your qualifications, passion, and achievements with similar endeavors, and with the types of technologies you have worked with. Please note that responses with no detailed cover letter and/or only a resume will not be acknowledged or read.

Finally, I am based in Charlotte, NC and currently work as a Portfolio Manager for a non-related business, so this is why I am looking to be very generous for someone capable of moving this along. However, when the time comes, I am able to travel (or arrange travel) for any face-to-face meetings needed
